Kitty's To-do List App

- add new lists using the floting action button on bottom right.
- remove lists using the remove button on the right side of each list.
- edit each list by clicking on the list:
	- edit list name from the edit text field on the top.
	- add new tasks using the floating action button on bottom right.
	- edit task name and description from edittext fields within the list
	- remove tasks using the remove button on the right side of each task.
	- check off/uncheck completed tasks using the checkbox on the left side of each task.
	- when a task is checked off it will be grayed out and strikethrough.
	- use the x on the top right corner to close/save the list. (will not let you save if you do not have a list name).

possible bugs/things I didn't do:
- can add as many new lists and new tasks even if the previously added list/task are empty.
- list names and task names are not limited by number of character.
